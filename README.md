# 1.2.12 LAB: Flight booking system - part 1

## Level of difficulty  
### Medium  

## Objectives  
### Familiarize the student with:  
- Modeling real-world entities using classes and objects  

## Scenario  
Now that you're more familiar with classes and objects, let's imagine we're working on an airline flight booking system.  

Our system stores for each flight:  
- An identification number  
- The total capacity  
- The number of reserved seats  

Our first task will be to print a status report showing the percentage of capacity filled.  

The report should follow this format:  
`"Flight [id]: [reserved]/[capacity] ([percentage]%) seats taken"`  

For now, we won't limit the number of reserved seats. We'll work on that later.
